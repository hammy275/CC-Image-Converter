# CC-Image-Converter

Converts an image to the format used by ComputerCraft.

## Don't Other Converters Exist?

Yes, I just wanted to make one myself :p.


## What is videoplayer.lua ?

Put simply, the images generated by this can be sent to a CC computer, and be played back as if it were a video using videoplayer.lua!

In order to do this, you'll need to use something like `ffmpeg` to extract 10 frames of video every second (10 fps) from a video of your choosing. From there, place all the images (in `.png` format!) in the directory with `main.py` and run `python main.py -a`. This will generate all input images into output .nfp files, which can be transferred to use with the video player!

Example command on how to do the above with `ffmpeg`: `ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 -vf fps=10,scale=81x80 out%04d.png`

## What is videodownloader.lua

The above `videoplayer.lua` allows you to playback a video from images, but how do you get said images onto a CC computer? Well, that's what `videodownloader.lua` is for! After converting using this converter, run `python -m http.server` inside the directory with your `.nfp`s, port forward port 8000 to your computer, and use `videodownloader.lua` to get them!
